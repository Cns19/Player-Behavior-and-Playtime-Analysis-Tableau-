# Player Behavior and Playtime Analysis (Tableau)

**Goal:** To analyze player behavior based on age, activity, and playtime.

**Method and Tools:** Used Tableau to build a heatmap, show average playtime with labels (HH:MM), and segment users by age ranges.

**Result:** The game “Game Battle Pass” had a play rate always over 50%, higher than other games. Players aged 15–19 played the longest. The heatmap clearly showed that as age increases, average playtime decreases.

**Skills Gained:** Data segmentation, age group analysis, presenting insights with interactive visuals.
